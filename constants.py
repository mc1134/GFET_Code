==============================

Controls:
- Connect: connects to the IP address specified in the "Enter IP Address" field via SSH.
- Disconnect: disconnects from the connected microcontroller. Has no effect if not connected.
- Baseline: runs firmware module on connected microcontroller to produce a data file in 80-90
  seconds, or if the maximum timeout of {MAX_DOWNLOAD_WAIT_TIME} is reached the data collection stops and times out.
  Requires active SSH connection.
- Sample: does the exact same thing as the Baseline button.
- Baseline from file: opens a file selector popup, enabling you to load an existing CSV file
  to perform analysis on.
- Sample from file: does the exact same thing as the Baseline from file button.
- Q/C Test: runs a quality control test on the second sweep of the data. Produces hyperbolic,
  parabolic, moving mean, and linear approximations of the data curve, and generates a score
  based on the calculated parameters of all approximations. Plots results to the GUI. Performs
  quality control test on the most recently gathered data, i.e. either a sample or baseline,
  whichever was more recently gathered.
- Calculate Dirac Shift: calculates the absolute dirac shift between the sample and baseline.
  Requires both a sample and a baseline to have been run. Plots second sweep of both sample
  and baseline.

To exit, close the window. This will also close the spawned Windows command prompt window.
